# I am...A Project in Becoming

This multimodal coding tool is a great way to break the ice at beginning of your school year. Why not use code to help your students introduce themselves and to process where they are on their journey through life? It's also an easy way for you to promote coding literacy, computational thinking, and computer science knowledge in your classroom.

By working through the prompts in the index.html file, students will construct their own webtext explaining who they are, what they are doing, and where they are going. Before, I ask students to present their page to the rest of the class, I divide them into groups giving them 15 minutes to work together to debug their projects.  

This template also allows the user to mix and match div. blocks should students wish to further customize their work. It's a great introduction to code that will prepare students to use our other [CodELA Tools](https://github.com/orgs/CodELA-k12/repositories)

    
## Get started! 

1. Go to the [I am...A Project in Becoming repository](https://github.com/CodELA-k12/i-am-a-project-in-becoming).

2. Click the green "Code" button and then select "Download ZIP" to your local computer. 

3. Find this folder in your downloads. Move this folder to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

4. Download and/or open with a text editor like  

5. Use the text editor to open the index.html document from your project folder.  

6. Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text! 

7. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click  "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes." 

8. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" in the left-hand menu. Change the source setting from "none" to "main" "/root" and then Click "Save"

9. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL. (This process may take up to five minutes.)

10. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
